# Enterprise Data Quality & Risk Management Strategy

## 1. Data Governance Integration
- **Tooling:** Designing with metadata-first principles (e.g., preparing for Collibra metadata ingest).
- **Lineage:** Documenting data transformations from source systems to final dashboards to ensure auditability.

## 2. Report-Level Data Risk Assessment
- **Factor Formulation:** Defining metrics for data health (Accuracy, Consistency, Recency).
- **Scoring Model:** Developing an aggregate risk index to alert stakeholders of low-confidence data.

## 3. Design Sprints & Refinement
- Weekly reviews of data quality issues and subsequent model/procedure refinement based on root-cause analysis.
